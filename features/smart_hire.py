Lead Architect â€“ GenAI & DevOps
PwC US
05/2023 - Present, Bengaluru, India PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) is a global professional services firm offering audit, tax, and consulting services. It helps organizations solve complex business challenges, optimize operations, and drive innovation across industries.
Developed a multi-region hub and spoke cloud architecture using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles to manage scalable, distributed
environments. Played a key role in onboarding several enterprise clients to Azure, streamlining their operations and supporting their
transition to cloud-based services. Dived into the world of Generative AI, where I helped create and deploy multiple serverless applications on Azure Function Apps, enhancing
our ability to deliver innovative AI solutions. As the project gained traction, I helped transform it into a centralized hub for generative AI applications on Kubernetes, enabling efficient
communication between apps through Service Bus.
Implemented Helm for centralized Kubernetes management and KEDA for intelligent pod scaling based on message queue size, optimizing
resource usage and processing speed. Designed a robust DevOps framework that included CI/CD pipelines and automated database operations, which significantly improved our
deployment processes and overall project reliability, using Datadog for effective monitoring. Gained valuable experience with tools like Azure AI Search, Document Intelligence, Helm, and OpenAI, which enriched our offerings and kept
us ahead of industry trends.
Leveraged my understanding of generative AI application flow to troubleshoot and resolve issues, tracing requests from custom GPT through
Kubernetes ingress and pods. Used tools like Swagger and Datadog to efficiently identify root causes and implement effective solutions. Collaborated closely with the security team to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, implementing customer-managed keys for
encryption, establishing private endpoints for secure connectivity, and enforcing robust password and key policies, ensuring our architecture
met stringent company security standards.
Implemented an event-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline from scratch, serving as the backbone of projects. This
solution integrated AI services, including Service Bus, Storage Account, Document Intelligence, embeddings, and AI Search.
